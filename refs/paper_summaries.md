## Stellar Wakes from Dark Matter Subhalos
### https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03554

- Method:

1. Perturb the (homogeneous and steady-state) distribution function f0 of 
with a time-dependent inhomogeneous distribution function f1. Then Solve
the CBE. Solve for f1 assuming a density profile for the DM subhalo
and an f0 (Maxwell-Boltzmann).

2. Compute the likelihood of measuring the number of stars given a
perturbation due to a DM subhalo.

- Questions:

1. How many of these DM subhalos do we expect in the inner halos?
Wouldn't this be tidally disrupted by the disk?

2. When is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution a good approximation?


- Comments:

Statistical analysis and a code to compute the likelihood analysis.
Good theoretical derivation.
